# Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) – Executive Summary & Core Teachings

## Executive Summary

The Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) is the definitive roadmap for organizations adopting Azure. It provides a structured, end-to-end approach for cloud strategy, planning, readiness, migration, governance, security, and ongoing management. CAF is essential for Azure architects and AZ-305 candidates to ensure successful, secure, and well-governed cloud adoption.

## Core Methodologies (Phases)

CAF organizes the cloud journey into seven core methodologies:

1. **Strategy**
   - Align cloud adoption to business goals.
   - Identify business drivers, outcomes, and justification for cloud adoption.

2. **Plan**
   - Develop a cloud adoption plan, operating model, and migration strategy.
   - Assess skills, estimate costs, and prioritize workloads.

3. **Ready**
   - Prepare the Azure environment (landing zones, subscriptions, networking, identity).
   - Establish governance and security baselines.

4. **Adopt**
   - Migrate, modernize, or build cloud-native workloads.
   - Use proven migration and modernization patterns.

5. **Govern**
   - Implement policies, compliance, and risk management.
   - Use Azure Policy, Blueprints, and management groups for control.

6. **Secure**
   - Protect workloads with security controls and monitoring.
   - Apply Zero Trust, identity management, and threat protection.

7. **Manage**
   - Monitor, optimize, and operate workloads for performance and cost.
   - Use Azure Monitor, Cost Management, and automation tools.

## How to Use CAF

- **Sequential and Iterative:** Foundational phases (Strategy, Plan, Ready, Adopt) are sequential; operational phases (Govern, Secure, Manage) are continuous.
- **Scenarios:** CAF provides scenario-specific guidance (AI, SAP, Oracle, analytics, etc.).
- **Integration:** CAF integrates with the Well-Architected Framework and Azure Architecture Center for holistic guidance.

## Key Practices

- Use landing zones for scalable, secure environments.
- Apply governance and security from the start.
- Continuously optimize and manage workloads post-migration.
- Leverage CAF templates and checklists for each phase.
